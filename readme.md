# Welcome To This Chalet Unity Scene

This project was built in Unity 2018.2.11 and is best opened in that version of Unity.

This scene is a fairly simple scene with terrain and a large Chalet model with emissive planes providing light from the windows. Inside of its room there is a TV with a couch and lights.

There is also a simple camera animation that will take place if you press play.
